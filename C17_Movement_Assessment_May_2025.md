## Executive Summary

While scanning transponder activity over the Mediterranean, I identified a C-17A (01-0196, AE10BF) that disabled its transponder en route from Sicily to the Middle East. A full review of its two-week flight history shows routine Air Guard training and logistical support activity for NATO and CENTCOM.

## Subject Overview

Tail Number: 01-0196

HEX: AE10BF

Operator: 167th Airlift Wing, West Virginia Air National Guard

Type: C-17A Globemaster III

Known Callsigns: DECOY50, RSH720, RSH262


## Methodology

This report covers the C-17A's activity between May 5thâ€“24th, 2025. Sources include ADS-B Exchange, Flightradar24, and attempted visual confirmation via PlaneWatcher and JetPhotos.

Transponder deactivation during flights over high-risk or sensitive zones is a common U.S. military OPSEC protocol, particularly en route to bases like Al Udeid.

## Flight Activity Summary

_Note: During multiple periods, the aircraft's transponder was inactive or data was unavailable. Where relevant, movements are estimated based on last known position, direction, and time gaps. Contextual information is provided when possible to support assumptions._

**May 6-8: Training / Test Flights**

- Callsigns: DECOY99, DECOY50
- Operating around home base (Shepard Field WV)
- Short-hop pattern indicates training or test flights.

## May 13-16: NATO Logistics

- Callsign: RCH720
- Route:  WV to Duluth -> Rygge (Norway) -> return
- NATO AWACS logistics hub involvement (Rygge)

**May 20-23: CENTCOM Logistics**

- Callsign: RCH263
- Route: WV -> Norfolk -> Rota (Spain) -> Sigonella (Italy) -> Transponder off -> Qatar (likely Al Udeid)
- CENTCOM's largest middle east logistics hub involvement (Al Udeid)
- Transponder shutdown likely operational security

## Conclusion 

This assessment is based on open-source data. Inferred flight paths during transponder outages are reasonable assumptions, but they cannot be verified without more data.

C-17A (01-0196) is operating as expected within its strategic airlift role, supporting NATO and CENTCOM logistics. The transponder shutdown aligns with known operational security practices when flying over sensitive areas. No anomalous behavior detected. 

These movements correlate with an increase in NATO readiness and an uptick in CENTCOM logistics and regional movement in the Middle East.
